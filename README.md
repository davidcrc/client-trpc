This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## Look at this

- keep server and client in the same folder

server: https://github.com/davidcrc/mern-trpc-crud

- This is not a performance configuration for trpc

- A better solution will be handle cache query and update o remove from cache
